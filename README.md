# Markdown Previewer

This is the first project for Free Code Camp's Front-End certificate.

Completed On: 19 May 2016

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

**Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
**Rule #2:** Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories

- I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
- I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
